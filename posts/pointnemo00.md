# Point Nemo - The Search for the Most Isolated Location in Gielinor



### Introduction

>  Pole of Inaccessibility - a location that is the most challenging to reach according to some criterion. 

> In the IRL gamemode (essentially a HCIM with better graphics and more dead content), the most commonly referenced Pole of Inaccessibility is "Point Nemo" - a point in the South Pacific Ocean that is the farthest from land. Others exist, such as the Northern and Southern Poles of Inacessibility, as well as continental poles for Eurasia, Australia, Africa, and North and South America.

### The Game

I propose we play a game, the goal of which it to find Gielinor's Point Nemo. 

However, instead of just looking for the point that is farthest from a coast, we will be looking for a less geographically defined location. I want to find the most isolated location in Runescape. **In this sense, "isolated" just refers to a location where a player has no real reason to ever be there. **

Runescape is much too large to conduct this survey all in one go, so we will break down the search into major regions to find candidate locations for Runescape's Point Nemo. In this process, I hope to recapture some old feelings of exploration that I have lost, and maybe stumble upon some neat content or lore. 

Without further ado, we'll start in good ole Misthalin:
