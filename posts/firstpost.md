Welcome! I'm DiggyJohnson, and I'm excited to get going with this project.

### Why?

The idea for a blog started out as a joke between a buddy and myself. But upon thinking more about it, we realized there really isn't much written OSRS content (and I needed to practice my webdev and cloud architectures skills anyways). While Youtube/Twitch is the primary medium for content creators, it has a huge amount of overhead. On the other hand, blogging is as easy as opening a text editor and getting my thoughts on the page. 

Look for a post in the near future enumerating some of the content ideas we have for The Spicy Stew, and as always please do not hesitate to reach out with your own feedback and suggestions.
