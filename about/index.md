Welcome to The Spicy Stew! This blog was started mostly as a joke - but upon further analysis I realized that there really isn't any (off-Reddit) OSRS written content. 

## Who Stirs the Stew?

I've been playing Runescape since 2005, and while I have amassed thousands of hours in RS2/EoC and now OSRS, I've always taken a slightly more casual approach. I'm not the type of player that grinds1-77 RC in three days, or 3-tick fish for hours at a time. I jump around, set long term goals, and pursue those in some semi-efficient way.


I've followed Runescape content for almost as long as I've been playing. From the terrible PK montages of the late 2000s, to RuneShark's "Godsword Set from Scratch", to the madness of modern DMM tourneys, I've seen it all. I don't mean to brag, but I *am* a mod for AFriend's stream (lol...). 

After following all this content for literally over half my life, I'm excited to throw my hat into the ring.

As always, I am always open to community feedback, suggestions, or requests of any kind.
