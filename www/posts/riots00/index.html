<h3 id="introduction">Introduction <a class="direct-link" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>While it's unfortunate that it is ever necessary, the Runescape community has a long history of protesting. RS riots predate other familiar vectors through which players voice their discontent like bitching on the subreddit and crab emojis. In fact, rioting predates both Runescape subreddits and the crab emoji itself.</p>
<p>While rioting is fun in and of itself, the real goal of a good protest is to affect change. This goal is backed up by notable IRL players:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be the change you want to see in the world.</p>
<p>​						- Gandhi</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Hope and Change&quot;</p>
<p>​						- /u/PresidentObama</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just wanting change <em>really really badly</em> is not enough to ensure a good protest. Considerable work has been done investigating the effectiveness of civil unrest, with some scholars even claiming that protesting is outright ineffective.</p>
<p>UPenn sociologist Daniel Q. Gillion disagrees, though he agrees that not all protests are effective. Almost all sociologists agree that protest <strong>salience</strong> is one of the most important qualities of a successful protest (n.b. &quot;salience - def'n - the quality of being noticeable or important&quot;). It is on this factor - salience - that I want to analyze Runescape protests, focusing namely on the most recent Falador protest sparked by the embarrassing execution of the 2019 DMM Spring Finals.</p>
<hr>
<p>In his book <em>The Political Power of Protest</em>, Gillion identifies 6 factors affecting salience, in turn increasing the likelihood of the protest affecting real change.</p>
<p>They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether the protest lasts longer than a day</li>
<li>If there are more than 100 people involved</li>
<li>If police were present</li>
<li>If political organizations were attached to the protest</li>
<li>If there were arrests, injuries, or reports of property damage</li>
<li>Whether a death occured</li>
</ul>
<p>So without further ado, lets go through each of these factors and see how they relate to the DMM riot and other Runescape riots through history. I don't expect to make any huge claims by the end of this; I'll be satisfied by robust analysis that sparks discussion.</p>

<p>We didn't quite hit this mark last weekend. I logged in to Falador the next morning to an empty Falador square, occupied only by myself and a gaggle of shell-shocked guards sporting glazed eyes behind the literally shittiest helmets in Gielinor. More on these guys later.</p>
<p>We didn't manage to make it a day, but maybe that's find. Most Runescape riots don't last that long. However, there are some notable exceptions:</p>
<p><strong>Duel Arena Riot (20 November 2007 - 21 November 2007)</strong></p>
<p>Lasting just over a day, rioters protested an update to the Duel Arena that implemented a 3k cap on stakes. Sand Casino frequenters were tickled by this, and began rioting in World 83.</p>
<p>The wiki also claims there were considerable rioting in the <a href="http://runescape.com">runescape.com</a> Rant's forum which was a heavy dose of nostalgia. We should starting doing this again. Honestly, let's make the forums great again.</p>
<p><strong>Pay to PK Riot (10 December 2007 - 14/15/16 December 2007)</strong></p>
